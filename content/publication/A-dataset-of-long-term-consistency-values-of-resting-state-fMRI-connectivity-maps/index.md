abstract: The impact of multisite acquisition on resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) connectivity has recently gained attention. We provide consistency values (Pearson's correlation) between rsfMRI connectivity maps of an adult volunteer (Csub) scanned 25 times over 3.5 years at 13 sites using the Canadian Dementia Imaging Protocol (CDIP). This dataset was generated as part of the following article: Multivariate consistency of resting-state fMRI connectivity maps acquired on a single individual over 2.5 years, 13 sites and 3 vendors. Acquired on three 3T scanner vendors (GE, Siemens and Philips), the Csub dataset is part of an ongoing effort to monitor the quality and comparability of MRI data collected across the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) imaging network. The participant was scanned 25 times in the above-mentioned article - multiple times at six sites over a period of 2.5 years, and once at the remaining seven sites. Since then the participant was scanned an additional 45 times, allowing us to extend the dataset to 70 rsfMRI scans over a period of  greater than 4 years. In addition, we provide intra- and inter-subject consistency values of rsfMRI connectivity maps derived from 26 adult participants belonging to the publicly released Hangzhou Normal University dataset (HNU1). All HNU1 participants underwent 10 rsfMRI scans over one month on a single 3T scanner (GE). Connectivity maps of seven canonical networks were generated for each scan in the two datasets (Csub and HNU1). All consistency values, along with the scripts used to preprocess the rsfMRI data and generate connectivity maps and pairwise consistency values, have been made available on two public repositories, Github and Zenodo. We have also made available four Jupyter notebooks that use the provided consistency values to (a) generate interactive graphical summaries – 1 notebook, (b) perform statistical analyses - 2 notebooks, and (c) perform data-driven cluster analysis for the recovery of subject identity (i.e. rsfMRI fingerprinting) – 1 notebook. In addition, we provide two interactive dashboards that allow visualization of individual connectivity maps from the two datasets. Finally, we also provide minimally preprocessed rsfMRI data in Brain Imaging Data Standard (BIDS) format on all 70 scans in the extended dataset.
