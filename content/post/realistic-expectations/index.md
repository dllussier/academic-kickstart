title: BJJ, Judo and self-defense | Realistic expectations for martial arts
summary: There is a lot of debate about which martial arts are the best for self-defense and which are questionable for fighting in general. Here I discuss realistic expectations for Jiu-Jitsu and Judo in self-defense situations versus striking. This is done in the context of what can realistically be expected in common self-defense situations, with considerations for body type.
