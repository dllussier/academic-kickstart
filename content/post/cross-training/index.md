title: Benefits of cross-training BJJ and Judo | Complementary martial arts
summary: Today's requested video is on how Judo and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu can complement each other and work together for a more well-rounded combat sports game. In addition, I discuss cross-training in other martial arts, like Wrestling and Muay Thai, in the context of how they might also complement Judo or BJJ to become a more flexible and adaptable fighter.
