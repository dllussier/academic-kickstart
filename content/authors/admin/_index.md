Désirée Lussier’s research interests lie in the development and utilization of machine/deep learning techniques towards the solving of problems in neuroimaging. To this end, she is particularly interested in variational autoencoders and the use of graph convolutional neural networks. Her current research currently focuses on Alzheimer’s disease and autism spectrum disorders and the application of these methods to these and other conditions.
