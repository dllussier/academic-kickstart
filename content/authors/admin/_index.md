I am a Data Scientist and Artificial Intelligence Developer with experience in autogenerative (AI) and machine learning (ML) framework development for business intelligence, for which I have won a Bell Excellence and Innovation Award. I completed my postdoctoral research training in NeuroAI with the [SIMEXP laboratory](https://simexp.github.io/lab-website/) at the Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal (CRIUGM) at the Université de Montréal, focusing on machine learning, deep learning, and neuroimaging methods development for biomarkers discovery in multisite data. This resulted in the development and release of the Python package [Dynamic Parcel Aggregation with Clustering (DYPAC)](https://pypi.org/project/Dypac) for use with FMRI data. While there I was awarded the [Union Neurosciences et Intelligence Artificielle - Québec (UNIQUE)](https://www.unique.quebec/) NeuroAI Excellence Postdoctoral Scholarship Winter 2021. I am also the former Secretary and Art Exhibit Manager of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping [BrainArt Special Interest Group](https://ohbm-brainart.github.io/). 

My doctoral dissertation work investigated the relationship of brain morphology and oxytocin with chronic pain and pain sensitivity in older adults with the [Social-Cognitive and Affective Development Lab](https://ebnerlab.psych.ufl.edu/) and [PAIN laboratory](https://cruz-almeida-lab.dental.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida. There I earned my dual specialized PhD in Developmental Psychology and Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience. My master’s thesis investigated age-differential effects of intranasal oxytocin on “social brain” resting state functional connectivity in women. Prior to my graduate training, I worked as a clinical research associate at Seattle Children’s Research Institute with the [Psychology and Beahvioral Systems Lab](http://depts.washington.edu/pbslab/wordpress/) and the [Integrated Brain Imaging Center](http://ibic.washington.edu/#&panel1-1) at the University of Washington Medical Center, working with children with developmental disorders and learning disabilities in a research capacity.

I am also an artist and fitness coach, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu purple belt competitor, and Judoka having received my 1st kyu (brown belt) from [Shidokan](https://instagram.com/shidokan_dojo). I am the 2024 IBJJF Pan Am masters 3 female purple light-feather champion and 2022 Judo Canada newaza silver medalist (-63kg). For questions or coaching, you can reach me on Instagram at [thepurplebeltdiaries](https://www.instagram.com/thepurplebeltdiaries) or via email at deslussier@gmail.com  You can also check out my main Youtube channel [The Purple Belt Diaries](https://www.youtube.com/@thepurplebeltdiaries) where I discuss topics related to grappling.

My artwork, candles, and other designs can be found and putchased from my [Kawaii Magica Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/kawaiimagica) or my [Kawaii Magica Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kawaiimagica). There you will find goth, pastel goth, and other cute candles, artwork, decor and accessories, all handmade by me. I also take commissions and spacial orders.
